This consists of all the basic assest etc that are needed and to be tested to check the game works.

1) Basic movement + animation . 
		---- basic movement script completed (test)
2) Basic level + singleton to hold. (loading of json file) (player + clam + vegitation movement [hitbox when near?)]) - json Loaded.. and class created.
2a)Dynamic loading of level information, checking that the loading off screen works ok.. isVisible() etc?
		---- This works fine, no need to manally cull, bar on the actual artefacts on the objects.
3) Mob basic animation.
4) basic pickup + collition detection.
		---- Works, with calling parent scripts
5) Watch working / air count = death
6) Inventory working + basic Shop.
7) Check object placement (random on scroll)
8) Mob (sharks) movement
9) Basic Lighting (+ light to dark as you go deeper) +direction light for head? (caves)
		---- Lighting works + depth of sea affects lighting
10) Dropping of items (air)
